# Tic Tac Toe

Create a game of Tic Tac Toe. Two players take turns clicking somewhere to place an X or an O.
Any player that gets three of the same symbol in a row or diagonally, wins.

Rule 1:
You _must_ spend at least the first 10 minutes on a whiteboard talking to someone about:

- how to define the states
- how to detect a winning state
- which events to monitor
- the interface components layout
- the colors
- the headline
- which symbols to use for X and O (e.g. ðŸ˜œ and ðŸ¥Œ)
- the deployment

Rule 2:
You _must_ bring a repository online on day 1

Rule 3:
You _must_ bring the game online immediately, e.g. using Vercel. Even if it's
just a blank Vite app with a headline that reads "Tic Tac Toe".

## Let's go
First, create the base game, then the extended version - requirements below.

**Good luck!**

## Requirements (base game, 60 min)
- Draw a grid to play on, with 9 fields
- Click a field to set an X or an O, depending on which player you are
- Prompt the user to show whose turn it is
- Display who won as soon as somebody won

## Requirements (extended version, no time limit)
- Have a 'play again' button to play again
- Have a 'reset' button to reset the game
- Allow other symbols / random symbols
- Make it look _great_: colors, headline
- Make it _your own_: add a copyright notice, add _something personal_ - a wording,
  a headline, anything. Keep it more or less PG.
- If you're looking for more inspration, find other examples of a TTT game online.
