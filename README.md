# ðŸš€ Welcome to Week 23 ðŸš€

Get ready to sharpen your React skills with a focus on practical hooks, better
app design. We round it off with some fun project work using two-dimensional arrays

## Learning Objectives

- Reason about when to use `useCallback`
- Decide on an array of dependencies for a React hook
- Determine functionality of an application by reading code
- Use two-dimensional arrays
- Read from a URL's query string
- Interact with the DOM using `useRef`
- Understanding API documentation
- Describe and create elements of a good user experience in a web app
- Listen for keyboard events in a React app

## Questions

- When do I use `useCallback` and what's the alternative?
- How do I decide whether something is a dependency for a React hook?
- From looking at other people's code, can I understand what the code does?
- Can I understand foreign API docs well enough to start using the API?
- When looking at a website, can I spot common patterns that make it polished or
  unpolished?
- What is a callback function?

## Slides

- "More on state" - an idea how to approach the React Tic Tac Toe state management

## Reading

Dive into articles on hooks, dependency management, and async effects.

## Exercise: Reading other people's code

- Check out the `ReadingExercise.jsx` file in this repository
- Describe the resulting application _without_ running it
- Find the bug
- Describe what would make this code easier to read

## Exercise: Polish your weather app

- Add loading indicators
- Good keyboard support (autofocus, support for "Enter")
- Auto-refresh (and last refresh time)
- Responsive screen layouts
- Add a custom font from https://fonts.google.com
- Ability to start at another location by using a query parameter.
  Hint: look at the docs for `URLSearchParams` and try: `new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)`

## External Facilitation
